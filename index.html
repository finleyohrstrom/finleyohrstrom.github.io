<h2 style="backround-color: white"><b> Acid </b></h2>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white"> 
	<b>If</b> you’ve ever taken five tabs of LSD you probably know; things can get a little out of hand. Your subconscious at odds with your motor skills, your cognizant mind battling complete regression toward infantile inquisition, your muscles constricted tighter than fuck, and the rainbow of vomit you can’t quite feel hurtling out of your throat. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>I</b> really can’t really say much more than that. The point is by the time i needed to, it took me too long to put the car into park, and by the third pigment of vomit i had spit up, Willy was getting nervous about taking me into D.C.. I needed to know if i was breathing. I needed to feel the life rush into my chest and that wasn't going to happen on top of a parking garage. I wiped my mouth. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>“I’m</b> fine… let's go.” My voice is a quiet, extraordinarily poor representation of what was in my head.
	</p> 
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>We</b> moved with confidence down the stairs, excitement on a steep ascent to a three hour peak that was rapidly approaching. Stepping into the glass-walled skywlak that led us to our metro, i saw the most terrifying beasts. Standing up on their hind legs, i could feel their power of judgement that could desecrate a sentience. I could taste their intoxicated ego. Bend their illusion of a construct they’ll have your ass in a cage until the day you die. I was very far away from this beast, but the fear clouded in just what ways this was true. However, ego pushed on and i continued to fumble my way through the mechanisms and steps to get myself from where i was, to locked onto a metro seat so i could drown in my hyperactive sensory abyss for the duration of the ride. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>At</b> each stop a new herd would arrive and another would depart. This happened six times. Everyone was somewhere else but their marionette corpses danced in unison to notes of automated voices and arrival signals, aided by the conductor cueing entrance and exit through sliding train doors. They sit when they are told to sit. They do not block the doors. They do not speak or make eye contact. This is the child of safety and efficiency, dancing with the beasts on its own rope. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>My</b> primal was triggered. I fell out of my abyss and dropped hard into a state of intensive paranoia. In my relative confidence that the train was not moving i watched each beast stand, step, and depart the train. I furiously searched through the crowds and colors for familiarity, and quickly calmness ensued when i found Willie holding my arm on my left, and a malleable Eddie taking on any shape to slip in motion toward us. 
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times new roman ; backround-color: white">
	<b>I</b> tried to ask Willie what everyone was doing but my teeth were clenching too tight for me to open my mouth so i just muttered and moved my lips.
